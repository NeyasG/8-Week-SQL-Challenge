# üçΩÔ∏è Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

### Problem Statement

We're here to help Danny with his restaurant by providing insights using some data he has gathered.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

Danny has shared with us 3 key datasets for this case study:
