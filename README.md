# 👨🏽‍💻 8 Week SQL Challenge

This project follows a great course made by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/) called [Data with Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/) in 8 case studies of increasing difficulty aiming to improve your SQL skills and develop into a versatile Query..er? 

All the case studies can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) alongside any other resources. I'll display the datasets before any solutions so you can follow along if stuck, but remember please to not copy-paste my solutions as your own as a decent amount of effort has gone into this!
